# AmICooked? 🍳

**The honest reality check for your academic life.**

"Am I Cooked?" is an intelligent dashboard designed to answer the burning question every student asks before finals. It doesn't just look at your past grades—it analyzes your entire lifestyle to predict your academic trajectory.

## What does it do?

This tool takes a holistic look at your daily habits—how much you sleep, how often you attend class, your motivation levels, and even your social life—to calculate a simple, brutal, or reassuring score: **The Cooked Index**.

It acts as an early warning system. Are you *actually* chilling, or are you sleepwalking into a disaster?

## The "Cooked" Scale

Instead of vague probabilities, we give it to you straight on a 5-point scale:

1.  **Chilling 🧊** (Score 1)
    *   **Status:** You are thriving.
    *   **Forecast:** Easy A's. Keep doing exactly what you're doing.

2.  **Pretty Good 😌** (Score 2)
    *   **Status:** Solid ground.
    *   **Forecast:** You're on track for success, just don't get complacent.

3.  **Medium 😐** (Score 3)
    *   **Status:** The turning point.
    *   **Forecast:** Could go either way. A little extra effort now changes everything.

4.  **Concerning 😬** (Score 4)
    *   **Status:** Slippery slope.
    *   **Forecast:** Your current habits are dragging you down. Immediate changes needed.

5.  **Cooked 🍳** (Score 5)
    *   **Status:** Critical condition.
    *   **Forecast:** You are in the danger zone. Academic intervention required immediately.

## How it learns from you

This isn't a static quiz. "Am I Cooked?" uses **Active Learning**.

If the AI predicts you're "Cooked" but you ace your exam, you can prove it wrong. The system accepts your feedback ("I actually got a 95!") and retrains itself. Over time, it learns that maybe *you* are the type of student who can pull an all-nighter and still succeed, creating a smarter, personalized predictor for everyone.

## Why use it?

*   **Identify Blind Spots:** You might think skipping one class is fine, but the model might show it's your biggest risk factor.
*   **Visualize Your Data:** See clear trends in how your sleep or social life correlates with your academic performance.
*   **Get Peace of Mind:** sometimes you just need a robot to tell you that you're going to be okay.
